# research-internship-lpsm
Research internship project conducted at LPSM by a third-year student at ESPCI Paris â€“ PSL, studying the numerical resolution of stochastic optimal switching problems using deep learning. The approach combines backward induction with neural network approximation in one and two-dimensional settings.
